Using these modded xml / json files and instructions could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

I always recomend you validate your files at: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/ and https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

Instructions:

To download all of the files from the Github, click on the green "Code" button then "download zip" and extract / unzip that file onto your local PC hard-drive.

These simply pick the file with the weather you want to use, rename it to cfgweather.xml and upload it to your Server. 

(I have included the vanilla file when you want to revert.)

Re-start your server for the changes to take effect.

Thanks, Rob.
